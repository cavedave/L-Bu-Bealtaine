# Why 

We want people to learn Irish so we should provide them with easy access to materials to do so. Lá Buí Bealtaine by Máiréad Ní Ghrada is on the Junior cert syllabus and should have Irish Text, Irish Audio and English text available. This will allow the common [Listening Reading](https://www.jonkenpo.net/method-listening-reading/) [learning](http://how-to-learn-any-language.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=6366) method to be used.

The text is about 20 minutes long. So if people can read the english. Knowing the outline, carefully read the irish while listening to the audio. Go back and look up any difficult passages. Then listen to the audio again while commuting etc. That will allow them to learn a lot from this one text fairly easily. 

# Todo
